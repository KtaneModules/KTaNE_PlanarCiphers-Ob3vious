  title: Planar Ciphers
  author: Obvious
  description: So... you know those planes of existence from DnD? Well... I'm giving
    them all ciphers. Custom ciphers! Since there are 16 outer planes I'll need atleast
    42 more custom ciphers for this series. DM me suggestions if you have any. For
    now, enjoy Mechanus and Pandemonium Cipher :)
